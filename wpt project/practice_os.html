        <h3>1. Why is the operating system important?</h3>
        <p>
          OS is the most essential and vital part of a computer without which it
          is considered useless. It enables an interface or acts like a link for
          interaction between computer software that is installed on OS and
          users. It also helps to communicate with hardware and also maintains
          balance among hardware and CPU. It also provides services to users and
          a platform for programs to run on. It performs all common tasks
          applications require.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>
          2. What's the main purpose of an OS? What are the different types of
          OS?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The main purpose of an OS is to execute user programs and make it
          easier for users to understand and interact with computers as well as
          run applications. It is specially designed to ensure that the computer
          system performs better by managing all computational activities. It
          also manages computer memory, processes, and operation of all hardware
          and software.<br /><br /><strong>Types of OS:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Batched OS (Example: Payroll System, Transactions Process, etc.)
          </li>
          <li>Multi-Programmed OS (Example: Windows O/S, UNIX O/S, etc.)</li>
          <li>Timesharing OS (Example: Multics, etc.)</li>
          <li>Distributed OS (LOCUS, etc.)</li>
          <li>Real-Time OS (PSOS, VRTX, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>3. What are the benefits of a multiprocessor system?</h3>
        <p>
          A Multiprocessor system is a type of system that includes two or more
          CPUs. It involves the processing of different computer programs at the
          same time mostly by a computer system with two or more CPUs that are
          sharing single memory.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong
            ><u>Benefits:</u></strong
          >
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Such systems are used widely nowadays to improve performance in
            systems that are running multiple programs concurrently.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            By increasing the number of processors, a greater number of tasks
            can be completed in unit time.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            One also gets a considerable increase in throughput and is
            cost-effective also as all processors share the same resources.
          </li>
          <li>It simply improves the reliability of the computer system.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          4. What is RAID structure in OS? What are the different levels of RAID
          configuration?
        </h3>
        <p>
          RAID (Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks) is a method used to store
          data on Multiple hard disks therefore it is considered as data storage
          virtualization technology that combines multiple hard disks. It simply
          balances data protection, system performance, storage space, etc. It
          is used to improve the overall performance and reliability of data
          storage. It also increases the storage capacity of the system and its
          main purpose is to achieve data redundancy to reduce data
          loss.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><u>Different levels of RAID</u></strong
          ><br /><br />Nowadays, RAID is available in various schemes or RAID
          level as given below:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            RAID 0 - Non-redundant striping: This level is used to increase the
            performance of the server.
          </li>
          <li>
            RAID 1 - Mirroring and duplexing: This level is also known as disk
            mirroring and is considered the simplest way to implement fault
            tolerance.
          </li>
          <li>
            RAID 2 - Memory-style error-correcting codes: This level generally
            uses dedicated hamming code parity I.e., a liner form of error
            correction code.
          </li>
          <li>
            RAID 3 - Bit-interleaved Parity: This level requires a dedicated
            parity drive to store parity information.
          </li>
          <li>
            RAID 4 - Block-interleaved Parity: This level is similar to RAID 5
            but the only difference is that this level confines all parity data
            to a single drive.
          </li>
          <li>
            RAID 5 - Block-interleaved distributed Parity: This level provides
            far better performance than disk mirroring and fault tolerance.
          </li>
          <li>
            RAID 6 - P+Q Redundancy: This level generally provides fault
            tolerance for two drive failures.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>5. What is GUI?</h3>
        <p>
          GUI (Graphical User Interface) is basically a type of user interface
          that allows users to use graphics to interact with OS. GUI is created
          because it is more user-friendly, less complex, and easier to
          understand rather than a command-line interface. Its main goal is to
          increase efficiency and ease of use. Instead of having to memorize
          commands, users can just click on a button to simply execute the
          procedure. Examples of GUI include Microsoft Windows, macOS, Apple’s
          iOS, etc.
        </p>
        <h3>
          7. What are the different kinds of operations that are possible on
          semaphore?
        </h3>
        <p>
          There are basically two atomic operations that are possible: 1.wait()
          2.Signal()
        </p>
        <h3>8. What is a bootstrap program in OS?</h3>
        <p>
          It is generally a program that initializes OS during startup i.e.,
          first code that is executed whenever computer system startups. OS is
          loaded through a bootstrapping process or program commonly known as
          booting. Overall OS only depends on the bootstrap program to perform
          and work correctly. It is fully stored in boot blocks at a fixed
          location on the disk. It also locates the kernel and loads it into the
          main memory after which the program starts its execution.
        </p>
        <h3>9. Explain demand paging?</h3>
        <p>
          Demand paging is a method that loads pages into memory on demand. This
          method is mostly used in virtual memory. In this, a page is only
          brought into memory when a location on that particular page is
          referenced during execution. The following steps are generally
          followed:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Attempt to access the page.</li>
          <li>
            If the page is valid (in memory) then continue processing
            instructions as normal.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a page is invalid then a <strong>page-fault trap</strong> occurs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check if the memory reference is a valid reference to a location on
            secondary memory. If not, the process is terminated (<strong
              >illegal memory access</strong
            >). Otherwise, we have to <strong>page in</strong> the required
            page.
          </li>
          <li>
            Schedule disk operation to read the desired page into main memory.
          </li>
          <li>
            Restart the instruction that was interrupted by the operating system
            trap.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>10. What do you mean by RTOS?</h3>
        <p>
          Real Time Operating System (RTOS) is an operating system that is used
          for real-time applications i.e., for those applications where data
          processing should be done in a fixed and small measure of time. It
          performs much better on tasks that are needed to be executed within a
          short time. It also takes care of execution, monitoring, and
          all-controlling processes. It also occupies less memory and consumes
          fewer resources.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p><strong>Types of RTOS:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hard Real-Time</li>
          <li>Firm Real-Time</li>
          <li>Soft Real-Time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          RTOS is used in Air traffic control systems, Anti-lock Brake Systems,
          and Heart pacemakers.
        </p>
        <h3>11. What do you mean by process synchronization?</h3>
        <p>
          Process synchronization is basically a way to coordinate processes
          that use shared resources or data. It is very much essential to ensure
          synchronized execution of cooperating processes so that will maintain
          data consistency. Its main purpose is to share resources without any
          interference using mutual exclusion. There are two types of process
          synchronization:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Independent Process</li>
          <li>Cooperative Process</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>12. What is IPC? What are the different IPC mechanisms?</h3>
        <p>
          IPC (Interprocess Communication) is a mechanism that requires the use
          of resources like a memory that is shared between processes or
          threads. With IPC, OS allows different processes to communicate with
          each other. It is simply used for exchanging data between multiple
          threads in one or more programs or processes. In this mechanism,
          different processes can communicate with each other with the approval
          of the OS.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Different IPC Mechanisms:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pipes</li>
          <li>Message Queuing</li>
          <li>Semaphores</li>
          <li>Socket</li>
          <li>Shared Memory</li>
          <li>Signals</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>13. What is different between main memory and secondary memory.</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Main memory:</strong> Main memory in a computer is RAM (Random
          Access Memory). It is also known as primary memory or read-write
          memory or internal memory. The programs and data that the CPU requires
          during the execution of a program are stored in this memory.<br /><strong
            >Secondary memory:</strong
          >
          Secondary memory in a computer are storage devices that can store data
          and programs. It is also known as external memory or additional memory
          or backup memory or auxiliary memory. Such storage devices are capable
          of storing high-volume data. Storage devices can be hard drives, USB
          flash drives, CDs, etc.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>14. What do you mean by overlays in OS?</h3>
        <p>
          Overlays is basically a programming method that divides processes into
          pieces so that instructions that are important and need can be saved
          in memory. It does not need any type of support from the OS. It can
          run programs that are bigger in size than physical memory by only
          keeping only important data and instructions that can be needed at any
          given time.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>15. Write top 10 examples of OS?</h3>
        <p>Some of the top OS’s that are used mostly are given below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>MS-Windows</li>
          <li>Ubuntu</li>
          <li>Mac OS</li>
          <li>Fedora</li>
          <li>Solaris</li>
          <li>Free BSD</li>
          <li>Chrome OS</li>
          <li>CentOS</li>
          <li>Debian</li>
          <li>Android</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>16. What is virtual memory?</h3>
        <p>
          It is a memory management technique feature of OS that creates the
          illusion to users of a very large (main) memory. It is simply space
          where a greater number of programs can be stored by themselves in the
          form of pages. It enables us to increase the use of physical memory by
          using a disk and also allows us to have memory protection. It can be
          managed in two common ways by OS i.e., paging and segmentation. It
          acts as temporary storage that can be used along with RAM for computer
          processes.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>17. What is thread in OS?</h3>
        <p>
          Thread is a path of execution that is composed of a program counter,
          thread id, stack, and set of registers within the process. It is a
          basic unit of CPU utilization that makes communication more effective
          and efficient, enables utilization of multiprocessor architectures to
          a greater scale and greater efficiency, and reduces the time required
          in context switching. It simply provides a way to improve and increase
          the performance of applications through parallelism. Threads are
          sometimes called <strong>lightweight processes</strong> because they
          have their own stack but can access shared data.&nbsp;<br /><br />Multiple
          threads running in a process share: Address space, Heap, Static data,
          Code segments, File descriptors, Global variables, Child processes,
          Pending alarms, Signals, and signal handlers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Each
          thread has its own: Program counter, Registers, Stack, and State.

        <h3>18. What is a process?</h3>
        <p>
          The process is basically a program that is currently under execution.
          The main function of an OS is to manage and handle all of these
          processes. When a program is loaded into the memory and it becomes a
          process, it can be divided into four sections ─ stack, heap, text, and
          data. There are two types of processes:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Operating System Processes</li>
          <li>User Processes</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>19. What do you mean by FCFS?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>FCFS</strong> (First Come First Serve) is a type of OS
          scheduling algorithm that executes processes in the same order in
          which processes arrive. In simple words, the process that arrives
          first will be executed first. It is non-preemptive in nature. FCFS
          scheduling may cause the problem of starvation if the burst time of
          the first process is the longest among all the jobs. Burst time here
          means the time that is required in milliseconds by the process for its
          execution. It is also considered the easiest and simplest OS
          scheduling algorithm as compared to others. Implementation of FCFS is
          generally managed with help of the FIFO (First In First Out)
          queue.&nbsp;

        <h3>20. What is Reentrancy?</h3>
        <p>
          Reentrant is simply a function in which various clients can use and
          shares a single copy of a program during a similar period. This
          concept is generally associated with OS code and does not deal with
          concurrency. It has two major functions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Program code cannot change or modify itself.</li>
          <li>
            Local data for every client process needs to be stored in different
            disks.
          </li>
        </ul>
