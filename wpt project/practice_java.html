        <h3>1. Why is Java a platform independent language?</h3>
        <p>
          Java Language was developed in such a way that it does not depend on
          any hardware or software due to the fact that the compilor compiles
          the code and then converts it to platform-independent byte code which
          can be run on multiple systems.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The only condition to run that byte code is for the machine to have
            a runtime environment (JRE) installed in it
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2. Why is Java not a pure object oriented language?</h3>
        <p>
          Java supports primitive data types - byte, boolean, char, short, int,
          float, long, and double and hence it is not a pure object oriented
          language
        </p>
        <h3>3. Difference between Heap and Stack Memory in java..</h3>
        <p>
          Stack memory is the portion of memory that was assigned to every
          individual program. And it was fixed. On the other hand, Heap memory
          is the portion that was not allocated to the java program but it will
          be available for use by the java program when it is required, mostly
          during the runtime of the program.
        </p>
        <h3>
          4. Can java be said to be the complete object-oriented programming
          language?
        </h3>
        <p>
          It is not wrong if we claim that java is the complete object-oriented
          programming language. Because Everything in Java is under the classes.
          And we can access that by creating the objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          But also if we say that java is not a completely object-oriented
          programming language because it has the support of primitive data
          types like int, float, char, boolean, double, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now for the question:
          <strong
            >Is java a completely object-oriented programming language?</strong
          >
          We can say that - Java is not a pure object-oriented programming
          language, because it has direct access to primitive data types. And
          these primitive data types don't directly belong to the Integer
          classes.
        </p>
        <h3>5. How is Java different from C++?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            C++ is only a &nbsp;compiled language, whereas Java is compiled as
            well as an interpreted language.
          </li>
          <li>
            Java programs are machine-independent whereas a c++ program can run
            only in the machine in which it is compiled.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            C++ allows users to use pointers in the program. Whereas java
            doesn’t allow it. Java internally uses pointers.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            C++ supports the concept of Multiple inheritances whereas Java
            doesn't support this. And it is due to avoiding the complexity of
            name ambiguity that causes the diamond problem.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          6. Pointers are used in C/ C++. Why does Java not make use of
          pointers?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Pointers are quite complicated and unsafe to use by beginner
          programmers. Java focuses on code simplicity, and the usage of
          pointers can make it challenging. Pointer utilization can also cause
          potential errors. Moreover, security is also compromised if pointers
          are used because the users can directly access memory with the help of
          pointers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, a certain level of abstraction is furnished by not including
          pointers in Java. Moreover, the usage of pointers can make the
          procedure of garbage collection quite slow and erroneous. Java makes
          use of references as these cannot be manipulated, unlike pointers.
        </p>
        <h3>
          7. What do you understand by an instance variable and a local
          variable?
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Instance variables</strong> are those variables that are
          accessible by all the methods in the class. They are declared outside
          the methods and inside the class. These variables describe the
          properties of an object and remain bound to it at any cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the objects of the class will have their copy of the variables for
          utilization. If any modification is done on these variables, then only
          that instance will be impacted by it, and all other class instances
          continue to remain unaffected.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Local variables</strong> are those variables present within a
          block, function, or constructor and can be accessed only inside them.
          The utilization of the variable is restricted to the block scope.
          Whenever a local variable is declared inside a method, the other class
          methods don’t have any knowledge about the local variable.
        </p>
        <h3>
          8. What are the default values assigned to variables and instances in
          java?
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            There are no default values assigned to the variables in java. We
            need to initialize the value before using it. Otherwise, it will
            throw a compilation error of (<strong
              >Variable might not be initialized</strong
            >).&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            But for instance, if we create the object, then the default value
            will be initialized by the default constructor depending on the data
            type.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>If it is a reference, then it will be assigned to null.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>If it is numeric, then it will assign to 0.</li>
          <li>If it is a boolean, then it will be assigned to false. Etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>9. What do you mean by data encapsulation?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Data Encapsulation is an Object-Oriented Programming concept of
            hiding the data attributes and their behaviours in a single unit.
          </li>
          <li>
            It helps developers to follow modularity while developing software
            by ensuring that each object is independent of other objects by
            having its own methods, attributes, and functionalities.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is used for the security of the private properties of an object
            and hence serves the purpose of data hiding.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>10. Tell us something about JIT compiler.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            JIT stands for Just-In-Time and it is used for improving the
            performance during run time. It does the task of compiling parts of
            byte code having similar functionality at the same time thereby
            reducing the amount of compilation time for the code to run.
          </li>
          <li>
            The compiler is nothing but a translator of source code to
            machine-executable code. But what is special about the JIT compiler?
            Let us see how it works:
            <ul>
              <li>
                First, the Java source code (.java) conversion to byte code
                (.class) occurs with the help of the javac compiler.
              </li>
              <li>
                Then, the .class files are loaded at run time by JVM and with
                the help of an interpreter, these are converted to machine
                understandable code.
              </li>
              <li>
                JIT compiler is a part of JVM. When the JIT compiler is enabled,
                the JVM analyzes the method calls in the .class files and
                compiles them to get more efficient and native code. It also
                ensures that the prioritized method calls are optimized.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once the above step is done, the JVM executes the optimized code
                directly instead of interpreting the code again. This increases
                the performance and speed of the execution.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>11. Explain the concept of constructor overloading</h3>
        <p>
          Constructor overloading is the process of creating multiple
          constructors in the class consisting of the same name with a
          difference in the constructor parameters. Depending upon the number of
          parameters and their corresponding types, distinguishing of the
          different types of constructors is done by the compiler.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three constructors are defined here but they differ on the basis of
          parameter type and their numbers.
        </p>
        <h3>12. Define Copy constructor in java.</h3>
        <p>
          Copy Constructor is the constructor used when we want to initialize
          the value to the new object from the old object of the same
          class.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Here we are initializing the new object value from the old object
          value in the constructor. Although, this can also be achieved with the
          help of object cloning.
        </p>
        <h3>13. Can the main method be Overloaded?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, It is possible to overload the main method. We can create as many
          overloaded main methods we want. However, JVM has a predefined calling
          method that JVM will only call the main method with the definition of
          -&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>14. What is method overloading and overriding?</h3>
        <p>
          In Java, <strong>method overloading</strong> is made possible by
          introducing different methods in the same class consisting of the same
          name. Still, all the functions differ in the number or type of
          parameters. It takes place inside a class and enhances program
          readability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only difference in the return type of the method does not promote
          method overloading.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Method overriding</strong> is the concept in which two methods
          having the same method signature are present in two different classes
          in which an inheritance relationship is present. A particular method
          implementation (already present in the base class) is possible for the
          derived class by using method overriding.<br />Let’s give a look at
          this example:
        </p>
        <h3>
          15. Explain the use of final keyword in variable, method and class.
        </h3>
        <p>
          In Java, the final keyword is used as defining something as constant
          /final and represents the non-access modifier.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>final variable:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When a variable is declared as final in Java, the value can’t be
                modified once it has been assigned.
              </li>
              <li>
                If any value has not been assigned to that variable, then it can
                be assigned only by the constructor of the class.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>final method:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A method declared as final cannot be overridden by its
                children's classes.
              </li>
              <li>
                A constructor cannot be marked as final because whenever a class
                is inherited, the constructors are not inherited. Hence, marking
                it final doesn't make sense. Java throws compilation error
                saying -modifier final not allowed here
              </li>
            </ul>

            <strong>final class:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                No classes can be inherited from the class declared as final.
                But that final class can extend other classes for its usage.

          16. Is it possible that the ‘finally’ block will not be executed? If
          yes then list the case.
        </h3>
        <p>
          &nbsp;Yes. It is possible that the ‘finally’ block will not be
          executed. The cases are-
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Suppose we use <strong>System.exit()</strong> in the above
            statement.
          </li>
          <li>
            If there are fatal errors like Stack overflow, Memory access error,
            etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>17. When can you use super keyword?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The super keyword is used to access hidden fields and overridden
            methods or attributes of the parent class.
          </li>
          <li>
            Following are the cases when this keyword can be used:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Accessing data members of parent class when the member names of
                the class and its child subclasses are same.
              </li>
              <li>
                To call the default and parameterized constructor of the parent
                class inside the child class.
              </li>
              <li>
                Accessing the parent class methods when the child classes have
                overridden them.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>18. Can the static methods be overloaded?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes! There can be two or more static methods in a class with the same
          name but differing input parameters.
        </p>
        <h3>19. Why is the main method static in Java?</h3>
        <p>
          The main method is always static because static members are those
          methods that belong to the classes, not to an individual object. So if
          the main method will not be static then for every object, It is
          available. And that is not acceptable by JVM. JVM calls the main
          method based on the class name itself. Not by creating the object.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because there must be only 1 main method in the java program as the
          execution starts from the main method. So for this reason the main
          method is static.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>20. Can the static methods be overridden?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            No! Declaration of static methods having the same signature can be
            done in the subclass but run time polymorphism can not take place in
            such cases.
          </li>
          <li>
            Overriding or dynamic polymorphism occurs during the runtime, but
            the static methods are loaded and looked up at the compile time
            statically. Hence, these methods cant be overridden.
