          Data Structures and Algorithm Interview Questions
        </h1>
        <h3>1. What are Data Structures?</h3>
        <p>
          A data structure is a mechanical or logical way that data is organized
          within a program. The organization of data is what determines how a
          program performs. There are many types of data structures, each with
          its own uses. When designing code, we need to pay particular attention
          to the way data is structured. If data isn't stored efficiently or
          correctly structured, then the overall performance of the code will be
          reduced.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Why Create Data Structures?</h3>
        <p>
          Data structures serve a number of important functions in a program.
          They ensure that each line of code performs its function correctly and
          efficiently, they help the programmer identify and fix problems with
          his/her code, and they help to create a clear and organized code base.
        </p>
        <h3>3. What are some applications of Data structures?</h3>
        <p>Following are some real-time applications of data structures:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Decision Making</li>
          <li>Genetics</li>
          <li>Image Processing</li>
          <li>Blockchain</li>
          <li>Numerical and Statistical Analysis</li>
          <li>Compiler Design</li>
          <li>Database Design and many more</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>4. Explain the process behind storing a variable in memory.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A variable is stored in memory based on the amount of memory that is
            needed. Following are the steps followed to store a variable:
            <ul>
              <li>The required amount of memory is assigned first.</li>
              <li>
                Then, it is stored based on the data structure being used.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Using concepts like dynamic allocation ensures high efficiency and
            that the storage units can be accessed based on requirements in
            real-time.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          5. Can you explain the difference between file structure and storage
          structure?
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>File Structure:</strong> Representation of data into
            secondary or auxiliary memory say any device such as a hard disk or
            pen drives that stores data which remains intact until manually
            deleted is known as a file structure representation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Storage Structure</strong>: In this type, data is stored in
            the main memory i.e RAM, and is deleted once the function that uses
            this data gets completely executed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>6. Describe the types of Data Structures?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Linear Data Structure:</strong> A data structure that
            includes data elements arranged sequentially or linearly, where each
            element is connected to its previous and next nearest elements, is
            referred to as a linear data structure. Arrays and linked lists are
            two examples of linear data structures.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Non-Linear Data Structure:</strong> Non-linear data
            structures are data structures in which data elements are not
            arranged linearly or sequentially. We cannot walk through all
            elements in one pass in a non-linear data structure, as in a linear
            data structure. Trees and graphs are two examples of non-linear data
            structures.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          7. What is a stack data structure? What are the applications of stack?
        </h3>
        <p>
          A stack is a data structure that is used to represent the state of an
          application at a particular point in time. The stack consists of a
          series of items that are added to the top of the stack and then
          removed from the top. It is a linear data structure that follows a
          particular order in which operations are performed. LIFO (Last In
          First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out) are two possible orders. A
          stack consists of a sequence of items. The element that's added last
          will come out first, a real-life example might be a stack of clothes
          on top of each other. When we remove the cloth that was previously on
          top, we can say that the cloth that was added last comes out first.
        </p>
        <p>Following are some applications for stack data structure:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It acts as temporary storage during recursive operations</li>
          <li>Redo and Undo operations in doc editors</li>
          <li>Reversing a string</li>
          <li>Parenthesis matching</li>
          <li>Postfix to Infix Expressions</li>
          <li>Function calls order</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          8. What are different operations available in stack data structure?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Some of the main operations provided in the stack data structure
          are:&nbsp;
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>push:</strong> This adds an item to the top of the stack.
            The overflow condition occurs if the stack is full.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>pop:</strong> This removes the top item of the stack.
            Underflow condition occurs if the stack is empty.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>top:</strong> This returns the top item from the stack.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>isEmpty:</strong> This returns true if the stack is empty
            else false.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>size:</strong>&nbsp; This returns the size of the stack.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>9. What is a queue data structure?</h3>
        <p>
          A queue is a linear data structure that allows users to store items in
          a list in a systematic manner. The items are added to the queue at the
          rear end until they are full, at which point they are removed from the
          queue from the front. Queues are commonly used in situations where the
          users want to hold items for a long period of time, such as during a
          checkout process. A good example of a queue is any queue of customers
          for a resource where the first consumer is served first.
        </p>
        <h3>
          10. What are different operations available in queue data structure?
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>enqueue:</strong> This adds an element to the rear end of
            the queue.&nbsp; Overflow conditions occur if the queue is full.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>dequeue:</strong> This removes an element from the front end
            of the queue. Underflow conditions occur if the queue is empty.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>isEmpty:</strong> This returns true if the queue is empty or
            else false.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>rear:</strong> This returns the rear end element without
            removing it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>front:</strong> This returns the front-end element without
            removing it.
          </li>
          <li><strong>size:</strong> This returns the size of the queue.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          11. What is array data structure? What are the applications of arrays?
        </h3>
        <p>
          An array data structure is a data structure that is used to store data
          in a way that is efficient and easy to access. It is similar to a list
          in that it stores data in a sequence. However, an array data structure
          differs from a list in that it can hold much more data than a list
          can. An array data structure is created by combining several arrays
          together. Each array is then given a unique identifier, and each
          array’s data is stored in the order in which they are created.
        </p>
        <p>
          Array data structures are commonly used in databases and other
          computer systems to store large amounts of data efficiently. They are
          also useful for storing information that is frequently accessed, such
          as large amounts of text or images.
        </p>
        <h3>12. Elaborate on different types of array data structure</h3>
        <p>There are several different types of arrays:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>One-dimensional array:</strong> A one-dimensional array
            stores its elements in contiguous memory locations, accessing them
            using a single index value. It is a linear data structure holding
            all the elements in a sequence.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Two-dimensional array:</strong> A two-dimensional array is a
            tabular array that includes rows and columns and stores data. An M ×
            N two-dimensional array is created by grouping M rows and N columns
            into N columns and rows.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Three-dimensional array:</strong> A three-dimensional array
            is a grid that has rows, columns, and depth as a third dimension. It
            comprises a cube with rows, columns, and depth as a third dimension.
            The three-dimensional array has three subscripts for a position in a
            particular row, column, and depth. Depth (dimension or layer) is the
            first index, row index is the second index, and column index is the
            third index.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          13. What is a linked list data structure? What are the applications
          for the Linked list?
        </h3>
        <p>
          A linked list can be thought of as a series of linked nodes (or items)
          that are connected by links (or paths). Each link represents an entry
          into the linked list, and each entry points to the next node in the
          sequence. The order in which nodes are added to the list is determined
          by the order in which they are created.
        </p>
        <p>Following are some applications of linked list data structure:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Stack, Queue, binary trees, and graphs are implemented using linked
            lists.
          </li>
          <li>Dynamic management for Operating System memory.</li>
          <li>Round robin scheduling for operating system tasks.</li>
          <li>Forward and backward operation in the browser.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          14. Elaborate on different types of Linked List data structures?
        </h3>
        <p>Following are different types of linked lists:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Singly Linked List: </strong>A singly linked list is a data
          structure that is used to store multiple items. The items are linked
          together using the key. The key is used to identify the item and is
          usually a unique identifier. In a singly linked list, each item is
          stored in a separate node. The node can be a single object or it can
          be a collection of objects. When an item is added to the list, the
          node is updated and the new item is added to the end of the list. When
          an item is removed from the list, the node that contains the removed
          item is deleted and its place is taken by another node. The key of a
          singly linked list can be any type of data structure that can be used
          to identify an object. For example, it could be an integer, a string,
          or even another singly linked list. Singly-linked lists are useful for
          storing many different types of data. For example, they are commonly
          used to store lists of items such as grocery lists or patient records.
          They are also useful for storing data that is time sensitive such as
          stock market prices or flight schedules.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Doubly Linked List: </strong>A doubly linked list is a data
          structure that allows for two-way data access such that each node in
          the list points to the next node in the list and also points back to
          its previous node. In a doubly linked list, each node can be accessed
          by its address, and the contents of the node can be accessed by its
          index. It's ideal for applications that need to access large amounts
          of data in a fast manner. A disadvantage of a doubly linked list is
          that it is more difficult to maintain than a single-linked list. In
          addition, it is more difficult to add and remove nodes than in a
          single-linked list.

          <strong>3. Circular Linked List:</strong> A circular linked list is a
          unidirectional linked list where each node points to its next node and
          the last node points back to the first node, which makes it circular.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4. Doubly Circular Linked List: </strong>A doubly circular
          linked list is a linked list where each node points to its next node
          and its previous node and the last node points back to the first node
          and first node’s previous points to the last node.

        <h3>15. What is an asymptotic analysis of an algorithm?</h3>
        <p>
          Asymptotic analysis of an algorithm defines the run-time performance
          as per its mathematical boundations. Asymptotic analysis helps us
          articulate the best case(Omega Notation, Ω), average case(Theta
          Notation, θ), and worst case(Big Oh Notation, Ο) performance of an
          algorithm.

        <h3>16. What is hashmap in data structure?</h3>
        <p>
          Hashmap is a data structure that uses an implementation of a hash
          table data structure which allows access to data in constant time
          (O(1)) complexity if you have the key.
        </p>
        <h3>
          17. What is the requirement for an object to be used as key or value
          in HashMap?
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The key or value object that gets used in the hashmap must implement
            equals() and hashcode() method.
          </li>
          <li>
            The hash code is used when inserting the key object into the map and
            the equals method is used when trying to retrieve a value from the
            map.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>18. How does HashMap handle collisions in Java?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The java.util.HashMap class in Java uses the approach of chaining to
            handle collisions. In chaining, if the new values with the same key
            are attempted to be pushed, then these values are stored in a linked
            list stored in a bucket of the key as a chain along with the
            existing value.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the worst-case scenario, it can happen that all keys might have
            the same hashcode, which will result in the hash table turning into
            a linked list. In this case, searching a value will take O(n)
            complexity as opposed to O(1) time due to the nature of the linked
            list. Hence, care has to be taken while selecting hashing algorithm.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          19. What is the time complexity of basic operations get() and put() in
          HashMap class?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The time complexity is O(1) <strong>assuming</strong> that the hash
          function used in the hash map distributes elements uniformly among the
          buckets.
        </p>
        <h3>
          20. What is binary tree data structure? What are the applications for
          binary trees?
        </h3>
        <p>
          A binary tree is a data structure that is used to organize data in a
          way that allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation. It is a data
          structure that uses two nodes, called leaves and nodes, to represent
          the data. The leaves represent the data and the nodes represent the
          relationships between the leaves. Each node has two children, called
          siblings, and each child has one parent. The parent is the node that
          is closest to the root of the tree. When a node is deleted from the
          tree, it is deleted from both its child and its parent.
        </p>
        <p>Following are some applications for binary tree data structure:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It's widely used in computer networks for storing routing table
            information.
          </li>
          <li>Decision Trees.</li>
