          <strong>What is a Technical Interview?</strong>
        </div>
        <p>
          Technical interviews are a part of the hiring process for technical
          professionals: it's a highly focused and rigorous process that
          assesses your technical skills, personality, and problem-solving
          abilities. In the same vein as "show, don't tell," you need to
          demonstrate your skills to the interviewer, rather than just stating
          them. The purpose of a technical interview isn't to trick you with
          riddles, brainteasers, or impossible questions, but rather to see how
          you tackle real-world problems, such as those you may encounter once
          you get hired. For the majority of us, technical interviews are a
          nightmare come true (with 3-4 interview rounds, remote coding
          challenges, and even full-day onsite interviews). Even though they are
          intimidating, it is much easier when you know what to expect and have
          invested time into interview preparation.
        </p>
        <p class="ib-iq-page__description">
          Technical Interviews are notoriously unpredictable. As an applicant,
          you are likely to encounter some of the standard technical interview
          questions from different categories (think of behavioral questions,
          questions regarding education, situation-based questions, questions
          about one's technical knowledge, experience, certifications, knowledge
          of project management systems, etc.). Here are a few:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Which programming languages do you use regularly in your work?
          </li>
          <li>
            Do you have any technical certifications that make you qualified for
            this job?
          </li>
          <li>
            Can you explain the most rewarding project you have worked on so
            far? Can you elaborate on your part in it?
          </li>
          <li>
            What steps do you take to ensure accurate estimates for a project?
          </li>
          <li>
            Are you familiar with two-tier architecture? Explain its elements
            and uses.

          <strong>How to Prepare for a Technical Interview?</strong>
        </div>
        <p>
          Listed below are a few tips for interviewing for technical positions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            An important step is to review the job description to determine what
            you need to study. This may involve learning data structures, coding
            in a specific language, or using business intelligence tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            Explain your approach to solving problems and logical reasoning.
            This points out your problem-solving and critical thinking abilities
            to a hiring manager.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not hesitate to ask for more information if you do not understand
            the question. In case you do not know the answer to a question, tell
            the interviewer or ask probing questions to learn more. This may aid
            you in finding the right answer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Attempt coding assignments and brain teasers to improve your
            programming skills.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Preparation is an important aspect of doing well during the job
          interview process, but it's difficult to plan ahead when you don't
          know what to expect at interviews. Nowadays, technical interviews are
          extensive and rigorous. It is especially true given that the hiring
          processes of many IT Companies can vary, making it most difficult for
          you to know what to expect. Also, certain positions require specific
          programming languages, tools, and technologies. To bridge the gap and
          alleviate your anxiety, we've created a popular set of guides to help
          you figure out what to expect at tech interviews and how you can
          prepare for it. These guides are structured in an easy-to-follow,
          step-by-step format that covers all aspects of software engineering
          interview preparation such as technical interview rounds, interview
          questions, coding problems, and MCQs, as well as tips for
          interviewing.

          <strong>Programming (Language, Tools &amp; Technologies)</strong>
        </div>
        <p>
          Programming is an inexplicably vast and growing field, which makes
          software development one of the most promising careers. This makes
          software programming a very competitive field, where you must be
          proficient in various programming languages, tools, and technologies
          to gain employment at top tech companies such as Facebook, Amazon,
          Apple, Google, and so on. In light of that, how can you determine
          which language to choose and master for your tech interview? Your
          choice should be based on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Career scope and job opportunities</li>
          <li>Job requirements</li>
          <li>Your learning objectives</li>
          <li>Salary bands and Interest</li>
