        <h3>1. What is Database?</h3>
        <p>
          A database is an organized collection of data, stored and retrieved
          digitally from a remote or local computer system. Databases can be
          vast and complex, and such databases are developed using fixed design
          and modeling approaches.
        </p>
        <h3>2. What is DBMS?</h3>
        <p>
          DBMS stands for Database Management System. DBMS is a system software
          responsible for the creation, retrieval, updation, and management of
          the database. It ensures that our data is consistent, organized, and
          is easily accessible by serving as an interface between the database
          and its end-users or application software.
        </p>
        <h3>3. What is RDBMS? How is it different from DBMS?</h3>
        <p>
          RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. The key
          difference
          <a
            href="https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/difference-between-dbms-and-rdbms/"
            target="_blank"
            rel=""
            >here</a
          >, compared to DBMS, is that RDBMS stores data in the form of a
          collection of tables, and relations can be defined between the common
          fields of these tables. Most modern database management systems like
          MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2, and Amazon Redshift are
          based on RDBMS.
        </p>
        <h3>4. What is SQL?</h3>
        <p>
          SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is the standard language
          for relational database management systems. It is especially useful in
          handling organized data comprised of entities (variables) and
          relations between different entities of the data.
        </p>
        <h3>5. What is the difference between SQL and MySQL?</h3>
        <p>
          SQL is a standard language for retrieving and manipulating structured
          databases. On the contrary, MySQL is a relational database management
          system, like SQL Server, Oracle or IBM DB2, that is used to manage SQL
          databases.
        </p>
        <h3>6. What are Tables and Fields?</h3>
        <p>
          A table is an organized collection of data stored in the form of rows
          and columns. Columns can be categorized as vertical and rows as
          horizontal. The columns in a table are called fields while the rows
          can be referred to as records.
        </p>
        <h3>7. What are Constraints in SQL?</h3>
        <p>
          Constraints are used to specify the rules concerning data in the
          table. It can be applied for single or multiple fields in an SQL table
          during the creation of the table or after creating using the ALTER
          TABLE command. The constraints are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>NOT NULL</strong> - Restricts NULL value from being inserted
            into a column.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CHECK</strong> - Verifies that all values in a field satisfy
            a condition.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>DEFAULT</strong> - Automatically assigns a default value if
            no value has been specified for the field.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>UNIQUE</strong> - Ensures unique values to be inserted into
            the field.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>INDEX</strong> - Indexes a field providing faster retrieval
            of records.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>PRIMARY KEY</strong> - Uniquely identifies each record in a
            table.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>FOREIGN KEY</strong> - Ensures referential integrity for a
            record in another table.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>8. What is a Primary Key?</h3>
        <p>
          The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each row in a table. It
          must contain UNIQUE values and has an implicit NOT NULL constraint.<br />A
          table in SQL is strictly restricted to have one and only one primary
          key, which is comprised of single or multiple fields (columns).
        </p>

        <h3>9. What is a UNIQUE constraint?</h3>
        <p>
          A UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different.
          This provides uniqueness for the column(s) and helps identify each row
          uniquely. Unlike primary key, there can be multiple unique constraints
          defined per table. The code syntax for UNIQUE is quite similar to that
          of PRIMARY KEY and can be used interchangeably.
        </p>

        <h3>10. What is a Foreign Key?</h3>
        <p>
          A FOREIGN KEY comprises of single or collection of fields in a table
          that essentially refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table. Foreign
          key constraint ensures referential integrity in the relation between
          two tables.<br />The table with the foreign key constraint is labeled
          as the child table, and the table containing the candidate key is
          labeled as the referenced or parent table.
        </p>
        <h3>11. What is a Join? List its different types.</h3>
        <p>
          The
          <strong>SQL Join</strong>
          >
          clause is used to combine records (rows) from two or more tables in a
          SQL database based on a related column between the two.
        </p>
        <p>There are four different types of JOINs in SQL:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>(INNER) JOIN:</strong> Retrieves records that have matching
            values in both tables involved in the join. This is the widely used
            join for queries.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: </strong>Retrieves all the records/rows
            from the left and the matched records/rows from the right table.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: </strong>Retrieves all the records/rows
            from the right and the matched records/rows from the left table.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>FULL (OUTER) JOIN: </strong>Retrieves all the records where
            there is a match in either the left or right table.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>12. What is a Self-Join?</h3>
        <p>
          A<strong> self JOIN</strong> is a case of regular join where a table
          is joined to itself based on some relation between its own column(s).
          Self-join uses the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN clause and a table alias is
          used to assign different names to the table within the query.
        </p>
        <h3>13. What is a Cross-Join?</h3>
        <p>
          Cross join can be defined as a cartesian product of the two tables
          included in the join. The table after join contains the same number of
          rows as in the cross-product of the number of rows in the two tables.
          If a WHERE clause is used in cross join then the query will work like
          an INNER JOIN.
        </p>
        <h3>14. What is an Index? Explain its different types.</h3>
        <p>
          A database index is a data structure that provides a quick lookup of
          data in a column or columns of a table. It enhances the speed of
          operations accessing data from a database table at the cost of
          additional writes and memory to maintain the index data structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are different types of indexes that can be created for different
          purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Unique and Non-Unique Index:</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Unique indexes are indexes that help maintain data integrity by
          ensuring that no two rows of data in a table have identical key
          values. Once a unique index has been defined for a table, uniqueness
          is enforced whenever keys are added or changed within the index.
        </p>
        <p>
          Non-unique indexes, on the other hand, are not used to enforce
          constraints on the tables with which they are associated. Instead,
          non-unique indexes are used solely to improve query performance by
          maintaining a sorted order of data values that are used frequently.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clustered and Non-Clustered Index:</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Clustered indexes are indexes whose order of the rows in the database
          corresponds to the order of the rows in the index. This is why only
          one clustered index can exist in a given table, whereas, multiple
          non-clustered indexes can exist in the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes is
          that the database manager attempts to keep the data in the database in
          the same order as the corresponding keys appear in the clustered
          index.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clustering indexes can improve the performance of most query
          operations because they provide a linear-access path to data stored in
          the database.
        </p>
        <h3>
          15. What is the difference between Clustered and Non-clustered index?
        </h3>
        <p>
          As explained above, the differences can be broken down into three
          small factors -
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Clustered index modifies the way records are stored in a database
            based on the indexed column. A non-clustered index creates a
            separate entity within the table which references the original
            table.
          </li>
          <li>
            Clustered index is used for easy and speedy retrieval of data from
            the database, whereas, fetching records from the non-clustered index
            is relatively slower.
          </li>
          <li>
            In SQL, a table can have a single clustered index whereas it can
            have multiple non-clustered indexes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>16. What is Data Integrity?</h3>
        <p>
          Data Integrity is the assurance of accuracy and consistency of data
          over its entire life-cycle and is a critical aspect of the design,
          implementation, and usage of any system which stores, processes, or
          retrieves data. It also defines integrity constraints to enforce
          business rules on the data when it is entered into an application or a
          database.
        </p>
        <h3>17. What is a Query?</h3>
        <p>
          A query is a request for data or information from a database table or
          combination of tables. A database query can be either a select query
          or an action query.
        </p>
        <h3>18. What is a Subquery?</h3>
        <p>
          A subquery is a query within another query, also known as a
          <strong>nested query</strong> or <strong>inner query</strong>. It is
          used to restrict or enhance the data to be queried by the main query,
          thus restricting or enhancing the output of the main query
          respectively. For example, here we fetch the contact information for
          students who have enrolled for the maths subject:
        </p>
        <h3>19. What is the SELECT statement?</h3>
        <p>
          SELECT operator in SQL is used to select data from a database. The
          data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.
        </p>
        <h3>20. What are some common clauses used with SELECT query in SQL?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>WHERE</strong> clause in SQL is used to filter records that
            are necessary, based on specific conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ORDER BY</strong> clause in SQL is used to sort the records
            based on some field(s) in ascending (<strong>ASC</strong>) or
            descending order (<strong>DESC)</strong>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>GROUP BY</strong> clause in SQL is used to group records
            with identical data and can be used in conjunction with some
            aggregation functions to produce summarized results from the
            database.
